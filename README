ovpnd - daemon to start/stop openvpn client without root privileges
===================================================================

It's really hard to use the openvpn client, as it either starts at boot,
or you have to start/stop it as root using the initsripts.
But in reality, you have to do something on your home or office network
quickly, you want to log on to the VPN, do your thing, and log off.

The solution is ovpnd, which listens in the background
through FIFO file /var/run/ovpnd.cmd.
You can start, stop or restart openvpn by simply writing a one-character
command into the FIFO.

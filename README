ovpnd - daemon to start/stop openvpn client without root privileges
===================================================================

It's really hard to use the openvpn client, as it either starts at boot,
or you have to start/stop it as root using the initsripts.
But the reality is, you have to do something on your home or office network
quickly, you log on to the VPN, do your thing, and log off.

The solution is ovpnd, which listens in the background
through FIFO file /var/run/ovpnd.cmd.
You can start, stop or restart openvpn by simply writing a one-character
command into the FIFO.

Operation           Command                      Mnemonic
---------------------------------------------------------
Start openvpn       echo u > /var/run/ovpnd.cmd  Up
Stop openvpn        echo d > /var/run/ovpnd.cmd  Down
Restart openvpn     echo r > /var/run/ovpnd.cmd  Restart
Quit openvpn/ovpnd  echo q > /var/run/ovpnd.cmd  Quit
